**BitsetSphere** is an interactive 3D visualization tool that maps the **bijection between power sets and binary strings** onto a sphere. It's designed to aid mathematical intuition and provide pedagogical clarity for students, educators, and researchers exploring combinatorics, set theory, and logic.

---

## Overview

BitsetSphere visualizes the function:

f: 2^X ‚Üí {0,1}^n

Each subset `Y ‚äÜ X` is mapped to a binary string `y = y‚ÇÅy‚ÇÇ...y‚Çô`, where:

- `y·µ¢ = 1` if `x·µ¢ ‚àà Y`
- `y·µ¢ = 0` if `x·µ¢ ‚àâ Y`

This binary string is then mapped to a point on a sphere, offering a spatial representation of set membership and binary encoding.

---

##  Features

-  Real-time animation to explore subset space
-  3D spherical mapping of subsets and encodings
-  Label display for binary and decimal representation
- Interactive table selection with synchronized highlighting
-  Clean PySide6 GUI with Matplotlib integration

---

##  Use Cases

- Visual demos in combinatorics and discrete math courses
- Teaching bijective mappings and encoding logic
- Exploring binary strings and set relationships interactively

---

## Installation

### Install from requirements.txt
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jguida941/BitsetSphere.git
cd BitsetSphere

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Alternative: Manual Installation
```bash

## üß¨ How It Works

Each subset of a user-defined set is encoded into a binary string. These strings are geometrically projected onto a sphere. Users can:

-   Select entries in the subset table to highlight corresponding points
-   Run animations to step through the entire subset space
-   Toggle labels and connections to adjust clarity vs. performance
-   Customize set elements and size (1-6 elements)
-   Click 3D points to select corresponding table entries

### Interactive Features

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Click table row | Highlights 3D points in red |
| Click 3D point | Selects corresponding table row |
| Start Animation | Cycles through all 2^n combinations |
| Toggle Labels | Shows/hides subset and binary labels |
| Toggle Connections | Shows/hides bijection lines |

---

## Future Work

-  Exporting graphs and data to CSV
-  Hamming distance-based layout mode
-  GPU-accelerated rendering for larger power sets
-  Built-in tutorial system
-  Web-based version for broader accessibility
-  Mobile-friendly interface
